## RED-WIZARD 

This is a port scanning and DNS enumeration tool made in python. But, unlike other port scanning tool that routes through normal network, this port scanner and DNS enumeration have a feature to run through the TOR Network. This feature surely comes in handy when you are a huge fan of anonymity.
